# Introductory Python Workshop
This repository contains a guide document and some data files for my Introductory Python Workshop.

## Note
If you are copy+pasting my code from the PDF file, you will probably get IndentationError every now and then.
That's because the PDF shows the spaces but does not let you copy them, so Python will complain when you run,
e.g. the example code after instruction #1. **Make sure your text looks like mine, don't just copy+paste it
expecting it to work.**
