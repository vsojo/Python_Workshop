## Python with Jupyter and Python refresher
In the compressed file `JupyIntro_PythonRefresher.tar.gz`, there is an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, and a Python refresher/summary/cheatsheet. The Python refresher is not meant as a full introductory document - please follow the PDF if you have zero or very little knowledge of Python.

:construction:This workshop is always under development.:construction:<br/>
If you find something that needs improvement, I would be very grateful if you could let me know.

:warning:**Warning:** If you are copy+pasting from the PDF file into your code, Python will probably give you an ```IndentationError``` every now and then. This is because spaces often do not get copied appropriately from PDF files.<br/>
:heavy_exclamation_mark:**Make sure your text looks like the one in the PDF.**:heavy_exclamation_mark: For your own learning process, it would in fact be best if you type each line of code yourself instead of copying and pasting.

Please do read the specifications of the license but, in brief, this means that I am happy for you to use any of these contents in your own work or teaching. If you do redistribute the materials, though -- whether you change them a little or a lot or leave them exactly as they are -- you must credit the originals, and you must never make any money off of the documents themselves, even if you make a lot of changes to them. You can of course get paid for teaching, but it must be clear to students that the documents themsevles are free (in both cost and access), both the original and anything you make from it.

:pencil:**Editing the original:** If you want to have the original MS Word document, please contact me, but I would much prefer it if you tell me when you find errors or areas that can be improved. Of course you may just want to adapt the document to the specific needs of your students, in which case I am very happy to share. Just write :)
