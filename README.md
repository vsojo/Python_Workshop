# Introductory Python Workshop
This repository contains a guide document and some data files for my Introductory Python Workshop.

:construction:This workshop is always under development.:construction:
If you find something that needs improvement, I would be very grateful if you could let me know.

:warning:**Warning:** If you are copy+pasting my code from the PDF file, Python will probably give you an ```IndentationError``` every now and then.

That's because the PDF shows the spaces but does not let you copy them, so Python will complain when you copy+paste+run
code such as the example after instruction #1. So:

:heavy_exclamation_mark:**Make sure your text looks like mine, don't just copy+paste it expecting it to work.**:heavy_exclamation_mark:

Please do read the specifications of the license but, in brief, this means that I'm happy for you to use any of this stuff in your own work or teaching. If you do redistribute it, though -- whether you change it a little or a lot or leave it exactly as is -- you must credit the original, and you must never ever make any money off of the document itself, even if you make a lot of changes to it. You can of course get paid for teaching, but it must be clear to students that the document is free (in both cost and access), both the original and anything you make from it.

:pencil:**Editing the original:** If you want to have the original MS Word document, please contact me, but I do prefer if you tell me when you find any errors or areas that can be improved. Of course you may just want to adapt the document to the specific needs of your students, in which case I'm very happy to share. Just write :)
