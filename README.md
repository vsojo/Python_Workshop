# Workshop - Data Analysis with Python
This repository contains code and data files for an introductory Python Workshop on Data Analysis.

In the compressed file `JupyIntro_PythonRefresher.tar.gz`, there is an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, and a Python refresher/summary/cheatsheet. The Python refresher is not meant as a full introductory document - please follow the PDF if you have zero or very little knowledge of Python.

:construction:This workshop is always under development.:construction:
If you find something that needs improvement, I would be very grateful if you could let me know.

:warning:**Warning:** If you are copy+pasting my code from the PDF file, Python will probably give you an ```IndentationError``` every now and then.

That's because the PDF shows the spaces but does not let you copy them, so Python will complain when you copy+paste+run
code such as the example after instruction #1. So:

You can of course get paid for teaching, but it must be clear to students that the documents and code themselves are free (in both cost and access). Again, this applies both to the originals and to anything you make from them.

:pencil:**Editing the original:** I would be very grateful if you tell me when you find any errors or areas that can be improved!
